			<h3>Restrictions</h3>
				<p>First of all, for this to work you must have a wireless adapter capable of packet injection and compatible with aircrack-ng (check aircrack-ng website por compatible wireless adapters list)</p> 
				<p>Fire up kali linux and open a terminal</p>

			<h3>Put Wifi Adapter in monitor mode</h3>
				<p>To start off we must put our wireless adapter in monitor mode - before this we could only catch traffic that was meant to us and now we will be able to see all the traffic that goes near us, even if it was not meant for us to see. </p>
				<p>So, we have to check our wireless adapter name, for this type <b>ifconfig</b> and it should be there, probably called <b>wlan0</b> or <b>wlan1</b>(in my case). Type this command:</p>
				<p id="command" style="margin-left: 50px; font-size: 25px"><b>airmon-ng start wlan1</b></p>
				<!--<p>If you get an error saying there are processes that could cause trouble, use <b>kill &lt;number_of_process&gt;</b> for each one of them, for instance: <b>kill 1476</b></p>-->
				<p>If you get an error saying there are processes that could cause trouble, type <b>airmon-ng check kill</b>, this will kill these processes.</p>
				<p>airmon-ng will rename <b>wlan1</b> to <b>wlan1mon</b></p>

			<h3>Capturing traffic with Airodump-ng</h3>
				<p>Type the following command:</p>
				<p id="command" style="margin-left: 50px; font-size: 25px"><b>airodump-ng wlan1mon</b></p>
				<p>Now you'll see 2 tables, the first one has the AP's(wirelesse Access Points), and the second one has clients, associated with the AP they are connected to.</p>

			<h3>Focusing Airodump-np on the Target AP</h3>
				<p>Now you have to look at the first table, and pick your target AP, then colect the following data:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>BSSID</b> - their MAC Address</li>
						<li><b>CH</b> - the channel the AP is operating on</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Open another terminal and type the following command</p>
				<p id="command" style="margin-left: 50px; font-size: 25px"><b>airodump-ng -bssid &lt;BSSID&gt; -c &lt;CH&gt; --write WPAHandshakeFile wlan1mon</b></p>
				<p>The <b>--write WPAHandshakeFile</b> creates a ".cap" file in the current directory that we will further use to crack the password with aircrack-ng.</p>
			
			<h3>Getting the Handshake</h3>
				<p>In order to capture the Handshake, so we can have the encrypted password, a client needs to authenticate to our target AP.</p>
				<p>So we have two options here: wait for someone to authenticate to the AP or deauthenticate one or more clients so they authenticate back automatically and we get the handshake.</p>
				<p>Let's deauthenticate a client, type:</p>
				<p id="command" style="margin-left: 50px; font-size: 25px"><b>aireplay-ng --deauth 1 -a &lt;BSSID&gt; -c &lt;Client_MAC_Address&gt; wlan1mon</b></p>
				<p><b>--deauth 1</b> means we are sending 1 deauthentication frame</p>
				<p>This is the hard part, sometimes you won't be able to deauth a client, or you will, but instead won't get the handshake, etc.. The aircrack-ng website has a page with the description of all the problems you can have getting the handshake. The causes to fail in this part of the hack are many and i won't cover them here. Just try other clients if it doesn't work at first.</p>
				<p>You may also get an error saying the wireless adapter is on the wrong channel, i suppose you should have typed <b>airmon-ng start wlan1 &lt;channel_number&gt;</b> but has you didn't run airodump-ng yet, you wouldn't know which channel to choose, so what i do is just to repeat the command until it matches the channel, ugly method, but it works.</p>
				<p><b>Important:</b> You will know if you got the handshake if you see it written in the top right corner of the terminal where airodump-ng is running focused on the AP.</p>

			<h3>(Air)Crack the password</h3>
				<p>Notice we are doing a Dictionary attack so you will only be successful if the password of the AP is on your wordlist, otherwise you won't crack the password.</p>
				<p>You have some wordlists built in kali linux on /usr/share/wordlists, like the famous "rockyou" list.</p>
				<p>So, to crack the password, type:</p>
				<p id="command" style="margin-left: 50px; font-size: 25px"><b>aircrack-ng WPAHandshakeFile.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</b></p>
				<p>It will now test all the passwords on the list. Keep in mind that this is a slow process and can take hours or even days, depending on luck and on the size of the wordlist.</p>

			<h3>Notes</h3>
				<p>Aircrack-ng cracks passwords using CPU, so it will always be faster if your processor's power is higher.</p>
				<p>Other way to crack WPA/WPA2 passwords is with <b>pyrit</b>, it uses GPU - your graphics - which is a lot faster. I'll cover that up in my next tutorial.</p>
